Here I create the backend side of a cashier application. this cashier application is used for open order type, so the payment status will be changed when the customer has completed the order or will leave the store. in this project, I use the creational pattern builder. I use this because I find it easier to build an application in stages and solve problems that arise in the creation one by one.
